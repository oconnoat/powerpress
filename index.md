title: Powerpress &mdash; a wrapper for impress.js
layout: post
---

The [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) framework is a really nice way of getting html presentations that don't just look like powerpoint.
However, I wanted to add a few features: a time bar, a quick-navigation menu bar, and speaker notes. I originally considered forking it, but now I prefer to
create a separate project which uses [Bower](http://www.bower.io) to manage the dependencies.

Please do fork and improve the code, it's a mess right now :)

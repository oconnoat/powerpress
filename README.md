#PowerPress
Wraps impress.js presentations with things like a timer bar, a way of adding speaker notes and some other small things.

## Getting it running
This project uses [http://bower.io](Bower) to download some useful js scripts, including impress.
just run ``bower install`` to get the libraries. I recommend reinitialising the git repo and creating a ``gh-pages`` branch, so you get public hosting of your presentation.
